# Web application to book volleyball courts loacted in SWFiS PWr

The application was created to make booking volleyball courts easier and to avoid conflicts.

Booking system is available only for those who received special invitation from admin (e.g. coach). User can add/update/delete a reservation by clicking on chosen date and hour on app's calendar. Coach should be informed about any actions on calendar. Coach should be able to export data with reservations to deliver it to porter. Coach might deactivate users' accounts in any time.

It's based on React and Redux technologies.
